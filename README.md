# Next Delivery Page - Backend

## Project Overview

This repository contains the backend API for the Next Delivery Page project. It is built using Nest.js and is designed to support the corresponding frontend application, which can be found [here](https://github.com/elenaharan/next-delivery-page).

## Getting started

1. Clone the repository:
   `git clone https://github.com/elenaharan/next-delivery-page-backend.git`

2. Navigate into the project folder and install dependencies:  
   `npm i`

3. Start the development server:
   `npm run start:dev`

This will start the server on http://localhost:3000.

CORS has been configured, so requests from the frontend should not encounter any browser-related restrictions or issues.
